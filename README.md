## Task
You will make a command line version game.

1. There are six colors: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow, White, Purple. 

2. The computer generates a secret composed of four random color sequence from given six colors

3. The player has to guess the secret 

4. The computer generates a clue based on the users guess in step 3

5. Steps 3 and 4 repeat themselves until the player guesses the secret

Your program needs to generate hints that help the user formulate their next guess. Clues are written with two characters:

'*' = correct color guess in correct location

'~' = correct color guess in WRONG location
